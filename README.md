### AgileEngine test assignment

Task: Create automated tests for login functionality for [this page](https://courses.ultimateqa.com/users/sign_in)

Made possible by:
* Selenium
* Pytest
* [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv)

Note that my email and password are hidden in .env file (for obvious reasons), so if you want to run these tests you'll have to use your own valid email and password.
